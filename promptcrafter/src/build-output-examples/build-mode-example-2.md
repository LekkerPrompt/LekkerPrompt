## Creative Writing Prompt: The Time-Displaced Object

### The Premise

In this world, time travel isn't achieved through complex machines built by scientists. Instead, it is a rare, natural phenomenon—a glitch in the fabric of spacetime. Small, inanimate objects occasionally slip through the cracks, arriving in the past or future. These items, known as "Chrono-Artifacts," are often overlooked, mistaken for lost trinkets, out-of-place antiques, or strange futuristic gadgets. They carry with them the faint, lingering echo of their proper time.

### Your Task

Write a story about a character who finds one of these time-displaced objects. The object shouldn't be a history-altering device or a futuristic weapon. Instead, it is something deeply personal, mundane, and yet, completely impossible.

**Choose one of the following catalysts, or create your own:**

*   **The Object from the Future:** Your character, a struggling artist, finds a worn-out sketchbook in a second-hand store. The first half contains sketches in a style eerily similar to their own, but the second half is filled with breathtaking masterpieces dated five years in the future, all signed with their name.
*   **The Object from the Past:** While renovating their childhood home, your character finds a small, intricately carved wooden toy horse clutched in the wall cavity. It’s the very same toy they lost in a traumatic childhood accident—an accident that took place a hundred miles from this house.
*   **The Object that Defies Logic:** Your character, a pragmatic software developer, receives a package containing a brand-new smartphone. It is a model that their company is set to announce next week. The phone’s photo gallery contains pictures of them with a family they haven’t met yet, living in a city they've never visited.

### Guiding Questions to Explore

*   **Discovery and Realization:** How does your character discover the object's true nature? Is it a slow dawning or a sudden, shocking revelation?
*   **Impact and Obsession:** Does the object bring comfort, fear, or obsession? How does it alter their perception of reality, free will, and destiny?
*   **The Connection:** Why this object? Why was it sent to your character? Is there a purpose behind its arrival, or is it purely a random cosmic event?
*   **Consequences:** What does your character do with this knowledge? Do they try to force the future they've seen, prevent a past tragedy, or destroy the object to reclaim their sense of normalcy? What are the unforeseen ripple effects of their actions?

Your story should focus less on the mechanics of time travel and more on the human, emotional, and psychological impact of holding a piece of impossible time in your hands.
