## About LekkerPrompt

Welcome to **LekkerPrompt**, a growing open source repository dedicated to advancing the use of prompt and context engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs).

LekkerPrompt's goal is to create a comprehensive suite of open source toolkits and resources that help developers, creators, and AI enthusiasts to craft exceptionally structured and contextualized prompts and LLM context. By enhancing your interactions with LLMs like GitHub Copilot _(but not limited to)_, LekkerPrompt helps you unlock their full potential.

## Featured LekkerPrompt Toolkit

### **PromptCrafter**

The **PromptCrafter** is the **first** featured toolkit in the LekkerPrompt launch, and is currently in active development to refine its capabilities and user experience. It is designed with prompt engineering techniques to provide a specialized [GitHub Copilot Space](https://github.com/copilot/spaces) for efficient, focused prompt building and enhancement.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Contextual References:** 
  - A curated collection of Markdown (`.md`) files that offer structured examples, templates, and guidance for effective prompt development.
2. **Global Instructions:** 
  - Optimized Copilot Space instructions in markdown format, streamlining your workflow with intelligent, productive LLM interactions. Within the PromptCrafter space, the model behaves solely as a prompt builder; accepting natural language input and returning only optimized prompts in markdown, with no additional output or functionality. ***No fluff, just prompt engineering magic.***
3. **Reliability Goal:** 
  - The toolkit aims for a near-100% success rate in producing expected output behavior based on user input, ensuring that the PromptCrafter interaction is both predictable and productive. 
  - As more testing is done, this success rate will improve.

> _Additional toolkits, including a library of high-quality prompts and templates, are planned for future releases._

## Future Plans

LekkerPrompt is building toward a robust, community-driven resource library for advanced prompt and context engineering. Upcoming releases will expand the repository with two primary types of collections:

1. **LekkerPrompt Originals**
    - Toolkits and resources developed entirely by LekkerPrompt.
    - Includes original guides, documentation, specialized prompt libraries, and context engineering templates.
    - ***Fully open source and fully open to LekkerPrompt community development.***
2. **Curated External Resources**
    - A handpicked selection of personally tested, high-quality external documentation, articles, and guides by the LekkerPrompt community.
    - Focuses on valuable third-party contributions to prompt and context engineering, presented with summaries and links for easy discovery.

### **Planned Repo Structure:**

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ lekker-toolkits/                # All LekkerPrompt-developed toolkits
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ promptcrafter/             #
â”œâ”€â”€ lekker-guides/                  # Original guides and documentation by LekkerPrompt
â”œâ”€â”€ external-guides/                # Curated markdown files linking to/summarizing third-party resources
```
This structure ensures a clear separation between internally developed and externally curated content, making it easier for users to navigate and contribute.
