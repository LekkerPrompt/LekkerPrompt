## 🛠 LekkerPrompt: Early Days

Welcome to **LekkerPrompt**, a growing repository dedicated to advancing prompt and context engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). As this project is still in its early stages, it currently features the first toolkit, **PromptForge**, with more to come.

### 🌟 Vision
My mission with LekkerPrompt is to create a comprehensive set of open-source toolkits that help developers, creators, and AI enthusiasts to create properly structured and contextualized prompts to enhance their interactions with LLMs like GitHub Copilot.

---

## 🚀 What's Inside?

### 🛠 **LekkerPrompt - [🔗Copilot Prompt Builder](https://github.com/sammyhamwi/LekkerPrompt/copilot-prompt-builder)**

#### The first ready-to-use [GitHub Copilot Spaces](https://github.com/copilot/spaces) toolkit that creates a LLM chat experience focused soley on prompt building and enhancing.

LekkerPrompt's Copilot Prompt Builder focuses on creating and enhancing prompts specifically within GitHub Copilot Spaces.
- Link to Copilot Spaces (In preview mode as of `09 Aug 2024`): [🔗Link](https://github.com/copilot/spaces)

### 
- **Contextual References**: Carefully curated markdown formatted .md files providing structured insights for prompt development.
- **Global Instructions**: Configuration file for optimizing Copilot Spaces, enabling streamlined workflows and productive interactions.

Additional toolkits are planned for future releases, including a curated collection of high-quality prompts and templates.

## ✨ Getting Started

1. **Explore Prompt Crafter and Set-Up Your Copilot Space**:
  - Open the [🔗promptcrafter/](https://github.com/sammyhamwi/LekkerPrompt/promptcrafter) directory to find a [🔗README.md](https://github.com/sammyhamwi/LekkerPrompt/promptcrafter/README.md) file to learn even more about the toolkit and how to set it up in your own Copilot Space envirnoment.
3. **Learn and Enhance**: Use the materials in the LekkerPrompt resource library to improve your prompt and context engineering skills.
4. **Stay Updated**: Follow and star the repository for updates as new toolkits are added to LekkerPrompt. _It would also mean a lot to a new open-sourcer <3_
