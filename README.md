## About LekkerPrompt

Welcome to **LekkerPrompt**, a growing open source repository dedicated to advancing the use of prompt and context engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs).

LekkerPrompt's goal is to create a comprehensive suite of open source toolkits and resources that help developers, creators, and AI enthusiasts to craft exceptionally structured and contextualized prompts and LLM context. By enhancing your interactions with AI, LekkerPrompt helps you unlock their full potential.

## Featured LekkerPrompt Toolkit

### **PromptCrafter Chat**

The **PromptCrafter Chat** is a focused web application for crafting, refining, and validating AI prompts. It's built using the ðŸ”—[T3-App Stack](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app) with Next.js App Router, NextAuth, Prisma, tRPC, Tailwind CSS, and a Gemini-compatible backend. 

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Multiple Modes:** 
  - Build mode for creating complete prompts from scratch
  - Enhance mode for refining existing prompts
2. **Task-specific Optimization:** 
  - Specialized options for coding, image generation, research, writing, and marketing tasks
  - Customizable tone, detail level, output format, language, and temperature settings
3. **Productivity Tools:** 
  - Create and manage presets for quick application to new chats
  - Save, reopen, delete, or export conversation history
  - User authentication via Discord or email magic links

#### **Getting Started with PromptCrafter Chat:**
1. **Set Up the Application**: Navigate to the ðŸ”—[`lekker-toolkits/promptcrafter-chat/`](https://github.com/LekkerPrompt/LekkerPrompt/tree/master/lekker-toolkits/promptcrafter-chat) directory and follow the setup instructions in the README.
2. **Requirements**: Ensure you have Node 24, a MySQL database, and a Google Gemini API key.
3. **Configuration**: Set up your environment variables for authentication, database connection, and API access.
4. **Run the App**: Use Docker for development or follow the standard setup process for production deployment.

## Future Plans

LekkerPrompt is building toward a robust, community-driven resource library for advanced prompt and context engineering. Upcoming releases will expand the repository with two primary types of collections:

1. **LekkerPrompt Originals**
    - Toolkits and resources developed entirely by LekkerPrompt.
    - Includes original guides, documentation, specialized prompt libraries, and context engineering templates.
    - ***Fully open source and fully open to LekkerPrompt community development.***
2. **Curated External Resources**
    - A handpicked selection of personally tested, high-quality external documentation, articles, and guides by the LekkerPrompt community.
    - Focuses on valuable third-party contributions to prompt and context engineering, presented with summaries and links for easy discovery.

### **Planned Repo Structure:**

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ lekker-toolkits/                # All LekkerPrompt-developed toolkits
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ promptcrafter-space/       # PromptCrafter Copilot Space
â”‚    â””â”€â”€ promptcrafter-chat/        # PromptCrafter AI Chat App
â”œâ”€â”€ lekker-guides/                  # Original guides and documentation by LekkerPrompt
â”œâ”€â”€ external-guides/                # Curated markdown files linking to/summarizing third-party resources
```
This structure ensures a clear separation between internally developed and externally curated content, making it easier for users to navigate and contribute.

> _Additional toolkits, including a library of high-quality prompts and templates, are planned for future releases._

## Look Around!

1.  **Set Up Your Copilot Space**: Navigate to the ðŸ”—[`promptcrafter-space/`](https://github.com/sammyhamwi/LekkerPrompt/tree/master/lekker-toolkits/promptcrafter-space) directory and follow the set up instructions to make a minimal PromptCrafter chat in ðŸ”—[Copilot Space](https://github.com/copilot/spaces).
2.  **Learn and Enhance**: Use the materials in the resource library to sharpen your prompt and context engineering skills.
3.  **Stay Updated**: **Follow** and **star** the repository for updates as new toolkits are added.
